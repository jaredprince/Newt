# Language
This is my attempt at creating my own programming language (name pending). It is written in Java, and since Java is the language I'm most comfortable with the syntax will be mostly based on Java. In some cases I will adjust the syntax to somoething that I think is more preferable, but for the most part any changes I make to the syntax will be for a personal challenge. I will also be adding numerous new features for the same reason. The language is not intended for practical use. I will be writing my own lexer and parser, not using any of the parser generating tools available.
