# Newt
This is my attempt at creating my own programming language, Newt (name subject to change).

It is written in Java, and since Java is the language I'm most comfortable with the syntax will be mostly based on Java. In some cases I will adjust the syntax to something that I think is more preferable, but for the most part any changes I make to the syntax will be for a personal challenge. I will also be adding numerous new features for the same reason. The language is not intended for practical use. I will be writing my own lexer and parser, not using any of the parser generating tools available.\

Features of Newt:

Typing - Variables are declared using a 'type name;' statement. However, a 'var' type can be used to declare a variable without giving it a type. In it's current iteration, Newt is dynamically typed. The final version, however, will be statically typed (although weakly, since variable can be given no type).

Complex Switch Statements:
